A component design system with React and Storybook

# Design System with React & Storybook

Focus on just a few components, the idea is to show how you would implement a design system and not build a complete system.

Figma Design I'm basing the UI library on:
https://www.figma.com/file/Y0fiRMQlgNUsNt7hvZKnea/Browk-UI-KIT-(Community)?node-id=2316%3A4372

Example Project: (Example Design System package)[https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system/tree/master/src/components]

Currently working on the buttons component:

- Priary button states, hover, active etc.

Building a design system using:

- React
- Storybook
- styled-components
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Jest
- Chromatic
- npm
- Auto
- GitHub Actions

What will we be building:

- Badge

- Buttons
- Avatar
- Checkbox
- Input

- Radio
- Select
- Icons
- Link
- Tooltip
  ???
- Textarea
- Highlight (for code),

ToDo:

- ESLint
- Testing
- Deploy to Chromatic, GitHub and NPM

Aim is to learn how a design system works from a developer perspective.

- Reusable UI components
- Design tokens: styling specific variable such as color and size.
- Documentation

Focusing on pure presentational components only.

- respond only to props
- no app specific logic
- data agnostic
  These are essential to allowing a reusable component.
